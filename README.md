# Brainstormer

A chat made in *golang* with additional functionality. Client made in React.

Use text commands to brainstorm ideas, adding pros and cons, and voting for and against ideas.

To run, use `go run src/main.go` on root.

If you edit the client, remember to create a new build with `npm run build` in `./client`. The go server serves build files.

PS: It's ugly.
